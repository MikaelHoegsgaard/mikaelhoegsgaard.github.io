I am a PhD student in the Foundations of Machine Learning Group at Aarhus University, led by [Kasper Green Larsen](https://cs.au.dk/~larsen/) whom I am also grateful to have as my advisor.
Before starting my PhD, I received a Bachelor's degree from the Mathematics Department at Aarhus University and a Master's degree in Statistics from the Statistics Department at Aarhus University.
My primary research interest is learning theory.
