# About
I am a PhD student in the Foundations of Machine Learning Group at Aarhus University, led by [Kasper Green Larsen](https://cs.au.dk/~larsen/) whom I am also grateful to have as my advisor.
Before starting my PhD, I received a Bachelor's degree from the Mathematics Department at Aarhus University and a Master's degree in Statistics from the Statistics Department at Aarhus University.
My primary research interest is learning theory.

<span style="color:white; background-color:#267CB9"> My PhD study is set to end at the end of August, and I am currently seeking either a PostDoc position or a full-time role. Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated! </span>

<b>On the importance of sentence length</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together bocome monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.<br><br>
    Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasent rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals -- sounds that say listen to this, it is important.
